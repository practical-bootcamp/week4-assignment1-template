# week 4 assignment

_Python Bootcamp for Data week 4 assignment_

 This week you learned how to work with data using Pandas and NumPy. From loading and reading datasets from different sources to plotting graphs and exploring common problems in data. You'll use that knowledge to complete the assignment in this repository using a Jupyter Notebook. The questions are in markdown cells while your work has to go in the code cells. Some variables are pre-defined for you, make sure you don't remove or change them because the automated tests rely on them.

> ðŸ’¡ This template repository is made for GitHub Classroom delivery, but can be used independently if you want to learn on your own.

## Assignment instructions

This repository uses automated grading (or testing). When starting, all automated tests will fail. Your task is to make them all pass.

1. This repository has a `requirements.txt` file that you will need to install in your system. Use `python -m venv venv` and then `source venv/bin/activate`. Use [these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for other systems. Finally, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
1. Go to the [assignment.ipynb](./assignment.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook and go through each of the question sections.
1. Follow the instructions for each code cell. Sometimes a new variable needs to be created. Other times a pre-created variable must be reused. 
1. Every time you push it will trigger automated tests. Each section might represent a few tests. **Ensure you don't change the variable names**.
1. Repeat the fix/push/verify cycle until all tests are passing and the [actions](/../../actions) tab shows a green.

> ðŸ’¡ As part of the GitHub Classroom setup, you might get an automated Pull Request created for direct feedback by your Professor or by the TAs.


## Resources

Use the linked resources in this section to review and reference any of the previously covered content. All questions in this assignment come from content previously covered in the bootcamp course.

### GitHub Copilot 
In this assignment, you'll use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). If you are using Codespaces, then the extension is already installed for you. Otherwise you can search for it in extensions on Visual Studio Code, and then install it. 

#### How to get GitHub Copilot for free
If you have an educational email address (usually one that ends on `.edu`) then you can validate your student or faculty status by [following this guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/step-by-step-setting-up-github-student-and-github-copilot-as-an/ba-p/3736279?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)

### How do I use Copilot
Copilot is an AI-assistive technology that will suggest you completions _that you must verify as correct_. Suggestions are accepted by hitting the `Tab` key. You can also write a _prompt_ as a comment. Suggestions will be generated after you hit the `Enter` or `Return` keys.

Use the [following videos from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/shows/introduction-to-github-copilot/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza) as a reference on how to get started.

## Bonus challenge
Open the [bonus-assignment.ipynb](./bonus-assignment.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook and go through each of the question sections. Follow the instructions for each code cell. This bonus assignment is not graded and will not trigger auto-grading. It is meant to be a challenge for you to practice what you learned in the course.
