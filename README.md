# week 4 assignment

_Python Bootcamp for Data week 4 assignment_

 This week you learned how to work with data using Pandas and NumPy. From loading and reading datasets from different sources to plotting graphs and exploring common problems in data. You'll use that knowledge to complete the assignment in this repository using a Jupyter Notebook. The questions are in markdown cells while your work has to go in the code cells. Some variables are pre-defined for you, make sure you don't remove or change them because the automated tests rely on them.

> ðŸ’¡ This template repository is made for GitHub Classroom delivery, but can be used independently if you want to learn on your own.

## Assignment instructions

This repository uses automated grading (or testing). When starting, all automated tests will fail. Your task is to make them all pass.

1. This repository has a `requirements.txt` file that you will need to install in your system. Use `python -m venv venv` and then `source venv/bin/activate`. Use [these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for other systems. Finally, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
1. Go to the [assignment.ipynb](./assignment.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook and go through each of the question sections.
1. Follow the instructions for each code cell. Sometimes a new variable needs to be created. Other times a pre-created variable must be reused. 
1. Every time you push it will trigger automated tests. Each section might represent a few tests. **Ensure you don't change the variable names**.
1. Repeat the fix/push/verify cycle until all tests are passing and the [actions](/../../actions) tab shows a green.

> ðŸ’¡ As part of the GitHub Classroom setup, you might get an automated Pull Request created for direct feedback by your Professor or by the TAs.
